    <h2>Submit your plea online</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <p>For <a href="">some offences</a> you may submit your plea online. In most cases that means you wonâ€™t need to come to court.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You must be pleading guilty to ALL charges</li>
      <li>Serious charges are not included</li>
      <li>The case must be listed to be heard at the Neighbourhood Justice Centre</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should seek legal advice to help you decide</p>

    <h3>What you will need</h3>
    <p>When filling out this form, you will need the complaint and summons or notice to appear. This explains the details of the offence and your court hearing information.</p>
    <p>You must submit your online guilty plea <strong>at least 2 business days</strong> before your court date.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <h3>What happens in court</h3>
    <p>Your plea of guilty will be provided to the court. The magistrate will either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>deal with the charge without you being there, or</li>
      <li>require that you come to court and adjourn the matter to another date.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <h3>After the hearing</h3>
    <p>If your online guilty plea is accepted by the court, we will let you know in writing of any penalty imposed. This may take up to 7 days after the hearing date.</p>
    <p>If your online guilty plea is not accepted by the court, you will be advised of the new hearing details. There may be consequences if you fail to appear then - for example, the magistrate may issue a warrant for your arrest.</p>
